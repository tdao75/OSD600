This was what I did to create a local branch and push it to my remote repos.

#make new branch in local repos
$git branch branchName
#make remote branch
$ git push origin branchName
# change to branchName
$ git checkout branchName
# create text file for branchName then enter the code here
$ vi branchName
# add the file to the branch
$ git add branchName
# save the file in the local reops
$ git commit -a
# push the local branch into the remote branch
$git push git@githug.com:userID/branch.git branchName
